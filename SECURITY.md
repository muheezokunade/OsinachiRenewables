### CI/CD Security Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline includes multiple security checkpoints:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Code formatting and basic security checks
2. **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection in dependencies
3. **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security issues
4. **Secret Detection**: Scanning for accidentally committed secrets
5. **License Compliance**: Ensuring no problematic licenses
6. **Build Security**: Scanning build output for sensitive data
7. **Post-deployment**: Security verification of deployed application

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these
steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. Report via Email

Send details to: **security@osinachienergy.com**

Include the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### 3. What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Initial vulnerability assessment within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Progress updates every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

### 4. Severity Classification

We classify vulnerabilities using the following criteria:

| Severity     | Description                                     | Response Time |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data breach              | 24 hours      |
| **High**     | Privilege escalation, significant data exposure | 72 hours      |
| **Medium**   | Limited data exposure, denial of service        | 7 days        |
| **Low**      | Information disclosure, minor security issues   | 30 days       |

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Authentication**: Use secure authentication mechanisms
3. **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
4. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
5. **Logging**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data
6. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

### Environment Security

1. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration
3. **Database Security**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
4. **File Uploads**: Validate and sanitize file uploads
5. **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS policies appropriately

### Development Security Checklist

Before submitting code, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and secure
- [ ] Security tests are included where appropriate
- [ ] Code follows security best practices
