Part 2: Visual & Design Guidelines
This section outlines the visual language of the brand, based on the provided logo and mood board.

2.1. Logo Usage
The primary logo (full color with text on a white or light background) should be used in the website header and in all primary brand communications.

The emblem (the stylized sun/turbine) can be used as a favicon, social media profile picture, and as a standalone design element (e.g., watermark, section breaks) where space is limited.

Clear Space: Always maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the letter "O" in "Osinachi." Do not crowd the logo with other elements.

2.2. Color Palette
Primary Blue: Deep Blue (#002A5C) - Used for headlines, footers, primary buttons, and as a background color for sections conveying trust, stability, and corporate expertise. It should be the dominant brand color.

Accent Yellow: Solar Yellow (#FFD600) - Used strategically for secondary buttons, calls-to-action, icons, and highlighting key statistics or benefits. Its purpose is to draw the user's eye to important actions and signify energy and optimism.

Neutral: White (#FFFFFF) & Light Gray (#F2F2F2) - Used for main page backgrounds to ensure clarity, readability, and a clean, modern aesthetic that allows the content and imagery to stand out.

2.3. Typography
Headings: A clean, bold, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins). Use Bold (700 weight) for primary headlines (H1, H2) and Semi-Bold (600 weight) for sub-headings (H3, H4) to create a clear visual hierarchy.

Body Text: A highly legible sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Lato, Open Sans). Use Regular (400 weight) for all paragraphs. Ensure a minimum font size of 16px and a line height of at least 1.6 for optimal readability on all devices.

2.4. Imagery Style
High-quality, professional photographs that feel authentic to the Nigerian context. Avoid generic stock photos.

Industrial/Commercial: Showcase the scale and complexity of your installations. Feature clean, well-organized wiring, robust mounting structures, and your team working professionally on-site.

Residential: Capture the outcomeâ€”the comfort and happiness of reliable power. Show well-lit homes, children studying, and modern appliances running smoothly.

Team: Feature images of the Osinachi team in branded attire, conducting energy audits, consulting with clients, or performing maintenance. This builds a human connection and reinforces your expertise.
