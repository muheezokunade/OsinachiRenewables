# Instructions to Save Muheez Okunade's Profile Image

## Steps:

1. Right-click on the circular profile image you shared in the chat
2. Save the image as `muheez-okunade.jpg` in this directory: `/client/public/team/`
3. The image should be saved as: `client/public/team/muheez-okunade.jpg`

## Alternative Method:

If you have the image file on your computer:

1. Copy the image file to: `client/public/team/muheez-okunade.jpg`
2. Make sure the filename is exactly: `muheez-okunade.jpg`

## Current Status:

- ✅ Directory created: `/client/public/team/`
- ✅ Temporary image in place: `muheez-okunade-temp.jpg`
- ⏳ Waiting for actual image: `muheez-okunade.jpg`

Once you save the actual image, the code will automatically use it instead of the temporary
placeholder.
